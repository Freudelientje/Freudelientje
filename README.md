## Hi there 🙋‍♀️ (♂️/She/Her)

> ### The more I learn, the more stupid I feel 🤔

* Educated on International Business (a long time ago)
* Background in ICT project support, as a functional application pro & trainer for Microsft business tools
* Now I manage craft beer product data in a wholesale organisation
* Looking into Data Engineering & Analysis (Azure & Power BI)
* I’m currently struggling with markdown, dax, Python and SQL
  * (other people did that in the past, I think I'm old enough to learn myself now)
* I need to freshen up Dynamics application knowledge, french, croaching (duh)
* I'm new to Github, and might need help https://docs.github.com/en
  * If you are also new, I recommend looking into https://github.com/katiehuangx/How-to-Create-a-GitHub-Portfolio
